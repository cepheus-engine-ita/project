## Die Roll Conventions

Cepheus: Faster Than Light uses common six-sided dice. We note each die
you need to roll as a “D”. Unless noted otherwise, “2D”, for example,
means “roll two dice and add the results together”.

In this game, DM means Dice Modifier – a number you add or subtract from
a dice roll. For example, “2D, DM-2” means “roll two dice, add the
results together, and then subtract 2 from the total”.

## The Basic Game Mechanic

The basic mechanic of Cepheus: Faster Than Light is the dice throw.
Throw 2D, add the relevant skill or characteristic DM, and if the total
is equal or higher than the target number, you succeed. For example,
“throw STR 8+” means “throw 2D and add your STR modifier; if the total
is 8 or more, you succeed” The amount by which your total throw exceeds
or misses the target number is called the Effect If, using the previous
example, you roll a total of 11 on that throw, your Effect is 11 – 8 =
3.

The average target number is 6+; easier tasks are 4+, and harder tasks
are 8+ or even higher.

A "natural" result of 2 is always a failure, regardless of skills or
other DMs. A "natural" result of 12 is always a success, even in adverse
situations.

***Opposed throws:*** in a situation where two characters oppose each
other in an attempt, for example a spy trying to sneak past a guard,
each character throws 2D plus the appropriate skill or characteristic
modifier; the higher roll wins. Re-roll ties.

# Character Generation

Your character starts the game as a skilled, experienced adult. Follow
the steps detailed in this chapter to generate a character and take them
through a career.

## 1. characteristics

Throw 2D six times. Assign as desired to your six characteristics -
Strength (STR), Endurance (END), Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT),
Education (EDU), and Social Standing (SOC). Some Referees will prefer
that you assign them in the order they are rolled, instead.

### Universal Personal Profile and Pseudo-Hexadecimal Numbers

You can list a character’s characteristics in shorthand, as a string of
numbers in the order given above, called a “Universal Personal Profile”,
or UPP. To denote numbers above 9, use a “pseudo-hexadecimal” system:

| **Characteristic** | **Letter** |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| 10                 | A          |
| 11                 | B          |
| 12                 | C          |
| 13                 | D          |
| 14                 | E          |
| 15                 | F          |
| 16                 | G          |

So, for example, a character with STR 7, DEX 12, END 6, INT 10, EDU 8,
and SOC 11 will have a UPP of 7C6A8B.

Normal humans cannot have a characteristic higher than 15 (F).

## Characteristic DMs

Each characteristic has an associated Dice Modifier (DM) based on its
value or score, as noted below:

| **Characteristic Score** | **Characteristic DM** |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 0-2                      | DM-2                  |
| 3-5                      | DM-1                  |
| 6-8                      | DM+0                  |
| 9-11                     | DM+1                  |
| 12-14                    | DM+2                  |
| 15-17                    | DM+3                  |
| 18-20                    | DM+4                  |

## 2. Homeworld

Think about the world the character grew up on and pick up any one skill
from the skill list (see next chapter) at Level-1 to represent what they
learned there before embarking on a career.

**Zero-Level Skills**

Normally, a character is either skilled in a task or unskilled. In the
latter case, they suffer DM-3 for lacking the appropriate skill.
However, we recommend that the Referee grant a few skills as
“Zero-level”. This means that while the character is not skilled enough
to hold down a job with that skill, and does not enjoy a positive DM on
rolls, the character is familiar enough with that skill to avoid the
unskilled penalty (DM-3). Recommended Zero-level Skills for all
adventurers include Athletics, Driving, Grav Vehicle, Gun Combat, Melee
Combat, and Zero-G. There is no need to write them on the character
sheet, as all adventurers and other characters with military or
paramilitary training have them – just keep that in mind when rolling.

## 3. Careers

Characters starts at the age of 18. To become skilled adventurers ready
to conquer the stars, they go through a career. Each career is comprised
of four-year terms of service. Each career table presents the different
throws needed for character generation.

Note that the total sum of a character’s skill Levels can never exceed
the sum of their INT + EDU characteristics.

This is how you go through a career:

**3.1 Choose any of the six careers presented below.**

**3.2 Resolve each term of service:**

1. *Survival throw:* If you fail, you die; roll up a new character.

2. *Skill table:* Choose one of the three main tables (Personal
   Development, Service, or Specialist) and roll on it once. Acquired
   skill levels are cumulative; the first time you receive a skill, you
   receive it at level 1. On your first term only, roll twice and gain
   two skills. If you have EDU 8+, you may choose to roll on the
   Advanced Education table instead.

3. *Advancement:* If you succeed, you gain one rank and gain an
   additional skill roll on any table you are eligible to roll on.

4. *Rank Skills:* If promoted, some ranks have skills associated with
   that rank. Gain that skill rank, if eligible. These are cumulative
   with existing skills.

5. *Re-Enlistment and additional terms of service:* If you want to
   continue to another term of service, make this throw; if you
   succeed, continue to another term; fail - and you finish your career
   (proceed to step 3.3: Mustering Out).

**3.3 Muster Out**: Once you complete your career, roll for Mustering
Out Benefits. Each term of service you completed allows you one roll on
one of the two Mustering Out tables: Cash or Benefit. You gain one bonus
roll if you are Rank O4, two if you are Rank O5, or three if you are
Rank O6. Characters of Rank O5 or O6 enjoy DM+1 on the Material Benefits
table; characters with the Carousing skill enjoy DM+1 on the Cash table.
No more than 3 rolls may be made on the Cash Benefit table.

### Mustering out benefits:

- *Contact:* a useful relationship with a person or group who can
  provide significant favors and/or jobs.

- *Free Trader:* a 200-ton Free Trader starship. Purchased under a
  mortgage.

- *Explorer's Society:* Membership in the exclusive Explorer's
  Society, which entails one high passage ticket every two months and
  free stay at Society hostels.

- *Passage:* get the named ticket for one jump (up to two parsecs).

- *Scout Ship:* a 100-ton scout ship "loaned" to you by the Scout
  Service as part of your "Detached Duty".

- *Weapon:* gain a single weapon up to Cr1000 in value including
  ammunition.

## 4. Round Out your character

Choose one skill you don't have yet; you receive it at level 1.

## 5. Reach to the stars and begin your adventures!

# Skills

Characters in Cepheus Light use different skills to confront the
challenges awaiting them among the stars, from piloting a starship to
shooting a laser. Skills are the character’s greatest asset. Skilled
characters are competent: Skill-1 is employable, while Skill-3 denotes
professional expertise and knowledge.

Below are the skills used by these rules:

**Admin:** administration and dealing with bureaucracies and the law.
Also covers forgery.

**Aircraft:** controlling and using atmospheric aircraft.

**Animals:** the care and training of animals. Also covers riding and
general agriculture.

**Athletics:** the ability to exert oneself physically. You may add the
Athletics skill to appropriate physical characteristic rolls. This skill
is never rolled unskilled.

**Carousing:** the art of mingling in social settings to achieve your
goals. Also covers gambling.

**Computer:** programming, working with computer hardware, and hacking.
This skill also covers the use of sensors and communications gear.

**Deception:** convincingly avoiding the truth and misleading other
people.

**Demolitions:** working with explosives to blow stuff up! This skill
also covers defusing said explosives before they blow up!

**Driving:** controlling and using ground vehicles.

**Engineering:** use and maintenance of starship drives and power
plants.

**Grav Vehicles:** controlling and using gravitic vehicles.

**Gun Combat:** using small arms, crossbows, and bows in combat.

**Gunnery:** using vehicle-mounted or spaceship-mounted weapons.

**Heavy Weapons:** using plasma guns, rocket launchers, and other
portable support weapons.

**Investigation:** this skill combines keen observation, forensics,
research, and detailed analysis.

**Jack o’ Trades:** this special skill reduces the unskilled penalty
(DM-3, noted above) by its level. For example, a character with Jack o’
Trades at level 2 would only suffer DM-1 to unskilled rolls. You may not
gain more than 3 levels in this skill and cannot improve it after
character generation.

**Leadership:** motivating and directing others, often in times of
crisis.

**Liaison:** the art and practice of negotiation and diplomacy in a
myriad of social situations.

**Medicine:** training in the medical sciences, from diagnosis and
triage to surgery.

**Melee Combat:** fighting hand-to-hand, either with a weapon or
unarmed.

**Piloting:** operating, controlling, and navigating interplanetary and
interstellar space craft, both in real space and in jump space.

**Recon:** scouting for danger and spotting threats.

**Repair:** the ability to maintain, repair and build mechanical and
electronic devices of all sorts. Also covers lockpicking.

**Science:** the multi-disciplinary scientific skill, as would be
typical for a starship’s science officer.

**Stealth:** training in being unseen and unheard.

**Steward:** the care and serving of passengers and other guests.

**Streetwise:** familiarity with underworld society and the ways of
working within it.

**Survival:** staying alive in the wilderness. This also covers
“outdoor” skills such as tracking, foraging, and fishing.

**Tactics:** tactical planning and decision making, whether on the
ground or in space.

**Watercraft:** controlling and using watercraft, including submarines.

**Zero-G:** working and living under microgravity conditions. Also
covers the use of vacc suits and heavy armor.

# Equipment

This chapter describes common tools, weapons, and other paraphernalia
used by interstellar adventurers, from flashlights to laser guns. Prices
are in Credits (Cr), the interstellar currency. Thousands of Credits are
noted as KCr, and millions of Credits are noted as MCr. A Credit is a
futuristic currency roughly equivalent to $3 USD in 2018CE currency.

Items come at various Tech Levels (TLs), denoting technological
complexity and progress. TL0 is equivalent to the stone age.; TL7 is our
modern day; TL8-9 are near future; and a typical "space opera"
interstellar polity would be around TL12-13.

## Personal Armor

Personal armor reduces the damage caused by incoming attacks. Subtract
the armor’s Protection rating from any damage caused to the character,
some types of armor require minimum levels of the Zero-G skill to use.
It is not possible to wear more than one type of armor at a time.

| **Armor**     | **TL** | **Protection**  | **Cost**  | **Skill Required** |

also serve as a vacc suit with 6 hours of life-support.

**Jack (TL1):** leather jacket or medieval leather armor.

**Mesh (TL6):** jacket lined with a flexible protective metal or plastic

**Powered Armor (TL13):** motorized combat armor. This powerful armor
Grants DM+4 to STR and DEX, though this does not apply to wound levels.
Powered armor grants DM+4 to all melee damage done by its wearer and is
shielded against vacuum and hostile environments, as a vacc suit, with 6
hours of life support supplies.

**Reflec (TL10):** anti-laser reflective armor. Reflec is highly

carries life support supplies for up to 6 hours. Counts as two items
towards encumbrance. Protects against Vacuum, Tainted and Exotic
atmospheres, as well as airborne pathogens. Protects against Corrosive
atmosphere for 2D hours, and against Insidious atmospheres for 1Dx10
minutes.

## Adventuring Gear

### Equipment Notes

An **Artificial Gill** allows unlimited underwater activity on worlds
with atmospheres 4-9.

**Fast Forward** is a drug that slows metabolism by a ratio of 60 to 1 –
a subjective day to the user is actually 2 months. Note that this drug
will greatly reduce life-support consumption.

Picking a lock without **Lockpicks** invokes a DM-2 penalty to the
attempt.

**Metabolic Accelerator:** provides DM+8 to initiative throws and allows
the user to take 3 actions per round rather than the usual 2. Effect
begins 8 rounds after application and lasts 10 minutes (60 rounds),
after which the user suffers 2D damage.

The **Multiscanner** combines several sensor functions: it can detect
radiation, electromagnetic emissions, metals, and a limited set of
chemicals and biological compounds.

The **Night Visor** combines low-light and infra-red vision.

Today’s smartphones eventually evolve into an **Omnicomm,** a tool
designed to meet all your telecom needs in one handy place, with
holographic augmented reality capability. The same applies the
**Omnicomp** – a hand-held, light-weight computer which evolved from
both the laptop and the tablet computer. TL9 batteries last for months
between recharging.

**Panacea:** allows any character, even those without the Medicine
skill, to neutralize diseases or poisons on a throw of Medicine 5+
(assume Medicine-0 for characters lacking the Medicine skill when
administering Panacea).

A **Pressure Tent** lacks an airlock and must be depressurized to enter
or leave; it can house up to 2 people and requires external oxygen
tanks.

A **Rescue Bubble** is a 2m-diameter plastic bubble. Piezoelectric
layers translate the user’s movement to electricity to recharge the
bubble’s battery. It contains supplies for 2 person/hours of operation.
The bubble’s skin can self-repair all but the most serious punctures.

A **Thruster Pack** allows maneuvering in zero-G conditions.

## 

## Vehicles

A wide variety of vehicles exist across cultures and species for
planetary, atmospheric, and oceanic transportation. The following is a
list of a few of the more common conveyances.

**Stat table explanation**

**Tech Level (TL):** technological level.

**Cost:** in thousands of Credits (Kcr)

**Agi:** Agility, representing the vehicle’s maneuverability. Applies as
DM to skill throws in vehicle combat.

**Spd:** speed in km/h.

**Light Damage Threshold:** Weapons have to throw this number or above
on their AV dice to penetrate armor and cause regular damage hits.

**Critical Damage Threshold:** Weapons have to throw this number or
above on their AV dice to cause a critical damage hit. Note that small
arms do not cause critical damage even in this case.

**Weapons:** weapons included in the vehicle’s price by default. Choose
support weapons from the Support Weapon table below. Support weapons use
the Heavy Weapons skill. Gunnery weapons use the Gunnery skill.

**Crew/Psgrs:** the first number shows the number of crew-members the
vehicle requires; the second, the number of passengers it may carry.

**Cargo:** cargo capacity in kilograms or tons.

### Vehicle Notes

The **ATV**, **Helicopter**, **VTOL Jet**, and **Motorboat** may each
mount one Support weapon, but it is not included in their price and must
be purchased separately.

**ATVs** are pressurized, have life-support supplies for a week, and
feature cramped living quarters for all crew and passengers.

The **Air/Raft** is a medium-sized gravitic car.

The **G/Carrier** is often called a Grav APC, though “Grav Transport
Helicopter” might be more appropriate.

The **Grav Belt** is a personal, wearable means of anti-gravity
mobility. Its fusion battery can last for a week.

The **Speeder** is a supersonic grav vehicle used for fast planetary
transport.

### Gunnery Weapons

Some of the vehicles listed above possess Gunnery Weapons, such as the
main gun on a main battle tank. These are vehicle-mounted or
fixed-position anti-armor weapons used to engage military targets. They
all use the Gunnery skill. As a rule of a thumb, gunnery weapons
generally do 10D damage vs. personnel within their effective range. They
have an AV value of 8D. The exact details of a given gunnery weapon are
left to the Referee.

## Weapons

Interstellar adventurers meet their adversaries with blades, bullets,
and lasers. Here we present a few common and iconic weapons used by
starfarers.

### Stat Explanations

**Tech Level (TL):** technological level, as noted above.

**Range:** Effective/Maximum in meters. To attack with a ranged weapon
within effective range throw Gun Combat (or Heavy Weapon) 8+; beyond
effective range, throw Gun Combat (or Heavy Weapon) 10+.

**Damage:** damage caused by the weapon.

**Magazine:** The amount of ammunition the weapon holds. If the magazine
requires additional time to reload, this will be noted.

**Ammo Cost:** per magazine, in Credits.

**Cost:** The weapon’s cost, in Credits.

**Weapon Aspects**

Weapons have Aspects describing their special characteristics, as noted
on their table.

**Auto X:** A weapon with the Auto aspect is an automatic weapon capable
of making attacks in three fire modes: single, burst, and full auto, as
described in the Combat chapter.

**AV X:** anti-vehicular dice. Throw this number of dice when you hit a
vehicle; if the throw is equal or greater than the vehicle’s armor
rating, the shot penetrates and causes a damage roll.

**Blast X:** This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise
effective against targets in its blast radius. The number given is the
blast radius in meters.

**Laser:** susceptible to Reflec armor. All lasers have the Zero-G
aspect automatically.

**Scattergun:** Scatterguns cause 4D damage at Effective range or closer
and attacks with scatterguns are DM+1. Anyone within 1.5m of the main
target is also attacked by the scattergun effect. Scatterguns enjoy DM+2
to hit flying targets within Effective range. Beyond Effective range,
scatterguns only inflict 2D damage and have no bonus to hit.

**Stun:** Damage is only deducted from END, considering any armor. If
the target’s END is reduced to 0, the target is incapacitated and unable
to perform any actions for a number of rounds by which the damage
exceeded his END. Damage received from Stun weapons is completely healed
after one hour of rest.

**Zero-G:** does not suffer a penalty for firing a weapon in zero-g
conditions.

**A note on unarmed damage:** any character can inflict at least 1 point
of unarmed damage (before armor, of course) even if their STR DM is 0 or
lower.

**Rocket Launcher (TL6):** Rocket launchers are unsafe to use in
enclosed spaces. Rocket payloads are considered high explosive and are
not particularly effective against armored vehicles. Armor piercing
rockets cost Cr500 per rocket: trade Blast 6 for AV 5D, Blast 1. An
anti-aircraft homing missile costs Cr10000 and does not suffer a penalty
when firing at fast-moving air vehicles.

**Common Explosives**

Throw DEX 6+ to accurately throw a hand grenade within effective range,
or Heavy Weapons 8+ to accurately launch a grenade from a launcher.
Throw Demolitions 6+ to properly set up an explosive charge for simple
demolition. The Effective range for thrown grenades is equal to the
character’s STR. Maximum range for thrown grenades is STRx2.

# Combat

Spacers and adventurers often run into trouble among the stars. In many
cases they will have to fight, be that for a cause or goal – or for
survival. The following rules allow quick resolution of combats. See the
weapon descriptions in the previous chapter for various special rules,
such as for automatic fire or explosive weapons.

### Combat Rounds

Combat takes place in 6-second segments called Combat Rounds. Characters
act in descending initiative order, as discussed below, in each combat
round – unless surprised or otherwise unable to act.

## Combat Procedure

**1. Surprise**

Before combat, in situations where surprise is possible, each party
throws Recon 8+. If one party succeeds and the other fails, the winner
gains surprise. If both sides succeed or both fail, there is no
surprise. A party deliberately setting up ambush gains DM+2 to surprise
rolls. Groups in vehicles, or groups of characters numbering 8 or more
members, suffer DM-2 to surprise rolls.

Surprise grants a “free” combat round during which the surprising party
may act, but the surprised party may not.

**2. Initiative**

When a fight begins, each combatant throws 2D + their Tactics skill for
their initiative score. Each round, combatants act in a descending
initiative order.

**3. Act in combat**

Each round, each combatant has two actions, as described below. Apply
any damage caused by an action immediately.

After all combatants have acted, begin a new round, until the battle is
over.

## Combat Actions

Each character has two actions per round, chosen from the following
list.

**Attack:** throw Gun Combat or Heavy Weapons 8+ (as relevant) to hit a
target in ranged combat. Increase this to 10+ if the target is beyond
Effective range. Throw Melee 8+ to hit a target in melee combat.

**Move:** move up to 10m (or six 1.5m squares). Alternatively, fall
prone or get up from a prone position.

**Overwatch:** delay your action until an enemy moves through your line
of sight or attacks you. When this happens, you may immediately act,
regardless of initiative order. You may hold your Overwatch for a number
of rounds equal to your END score.

**Ranged Combat DM Table**

| **Condition**                                      | **DM**                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Target obscured                                    | DM-1                         |
| Target behind hard cover                           | DM-2                         |
| Target running (double move on its previous round) | DM-1                         |
| Target behind total cover                          | DM-4; direct fire impossible |
| Target prone                                       | DM-2                         |
| Darkness                                           | DM-2                         |

### 

### Automatic Weapons

A weapon with the Auto aspect can make attacks in three fire modes:
single, burst, and full auto, as described below.

*Single:* Attacks are made using the normal combat rules.

*Burst:* Add the Auto score to damage. This uses a number of rounds
equal to the Auto score.

*Full Auto:* Make a number of attacks equal to the Auto score. These
attacks can be made against separate targets so long as they are all
within six meters of one another. Full auto uses ammunition equal to
three times the weapon’s Auto score. You may only perform one Full Auto
attack in a given round.

### Thrown Weapons

Knives have a range of 5/10. Throw DEX 8+ to hit with a thrown knife at
Effective range, or 10+ beyond it.

Throw DEX 6+ to accurately throw a hand grenade at effective range, and
8+ to place a grenade on target at maximum range. Hand grenades have an
Effective range of the thrower’s STR characteristic.

## Damage and Healing

Each weapon has a number of damage dice which are rolled and totaled;
add the attack throw’s Effect to the damage roll. This is the damage
inflicted on the character.

**Armor**

Subtract the armor’s protection rating from any physical damage caused
to the character before applying the damage to the character’s physical
characteristics.

**Applying Damage**

The first time a character takes damage, subtract it from the
character’s END. If this reduces the character’s END to 0, subtract the
remaining damage from STR or DEX (target’s choice). The damage may be
distributed between the two characteristics as desired by the target.

In any subsequent damaging attack, the target may allocate it to any of
the three physical characteristics (STR, DEX, or END), which is at 1 or
more, as desired.

If either STR or DEX fall to 0, subtract any further damage from the
remaining physical characteristic.

**Wounds**

If at least two physical characteristics remain above 0, the character
has suffered **Minor Wounds**. Use the reduced characteristics for any
relevant purposes, such as characteristic throws.

If one characteristic, including END, falls to 0 the character falls
**unconscious** for 1D rounds. Characters rendered unconscious in this
manner will wake up having recovered half their characteristics’ value
(rounded down). For example, a character with STR 9 who was so wounded
would wake up with STR 4 after 1D minutes. The character still suffers
**Minor Wounds** upon waking.

If two characteristics are reduced to 0, the character is **Seriously
Wounded**; they must throw 8+ or fall unconscious for 1D hours;
otherwise, they fall unconscious for 1D minutes instead. Upon waking,
the character’s wounded characteristics are 1. The character will
require medical care to recover any further.

Characters **die** if all three physical characteristics are reduced to
0.

**Healing and Medical Care**

**Minor Wounds** require treatment by a character with at least
Medicine-1, a Med Kit, and 30 minutes. Alternatively, characters will
recover from all Minor Wounds on their own after a full day’s rest.
Treatment or rest restores the wounded character's full characteristic
scores.

**Serious Wounds** require a medical facility—a standard starship medbay
will suffice—and treatment by a nurse or a physician (Medicine-2 skill
or better). Recovery takes 5D days. No recovery from Serious Wounds is
possible without medical care.

## Vehicle Combat

Sometimes, characters will find themselves operating a vehicle in
combat, or facing enemy vehicles. The following rules allow the
inclusion of vehicles in personal combat, as well as vehicle chases.

**Vehicle Tactical Movement**

In tactical (non-chase) combat, a vehicle moves on its driver's
initiative. Apply the vehicle's Agility as a DM to the driver's
initiative.

In personal combat, a vehicle can move up to 20m (14 squares on a 1.5m
grid) in a single round. This is considered cautious combat movement.
Fast-moving vehicles will pass through the tactical battle area in less
than a round. The chase rules below are designed to handle such high
speed combats.

**  
Chases**

The tactical combat rules represent action in small, more limited areas.
For vehicles, this means short range and slow speeds. As noted above, a
fast-moving vehicle will easily pass through the entire tactical combat
map in less than one combat round. This is unsuitable for chases and
dog-fighting. Use these rules instead. Chase turns are an abstraction in
combat and vary in length depending on circumstances, from mere seconds
in high-speed aircraft pursuits to hours in long drawn-out submarine
duels. The Referee should inform the players of how long each chase
combat turn is at the start of the chase.

There is no initiative throw in chases. Instead, at the start of each
turn both participants throw 2D + the relevant vehicle skill + the
vehicle's Agility. The pursuer wins on ties. The winner has Advantage
and may attack using the regular vehicle attack and damage rules, with
the following modifiers based on the vehicle throw's effect:

| **Effect** | **DM** |
| ---------- | ------ |
| 0          | DM-2   |
| 1 or 2     | DM-1   |
| 3 or 4     | DM+0   |
| 5+         | DM+1   |

The loser of the Advantage throw cannot attack in that turn, unless
their vehicle has a turret-mounted weapon. Turret attacks made without
Advantage suffer DM-4 to hit. Note that there is no tracking of range in
a chase. This is intentional. The attack penalty for low-Effect
Advantage rolls is meant to reflect a bad angle of attack, or
sub-optimal range for an attack, among other things.

It is possible to have multiple parties engaged in a chase. Simply
record the different Advantage results in descending order. The vehicles
higher on the “ladder” may attack any vehicle below them. This can be
used to great effect in a dogfight, below.

Chases last five turns. At the end of the fifth turn, if the prey has
not been stopped, disabled, or destroyed, the prey escapes and the chase
ends.

**Dogfighting**

In a dogfight, two or more highly maneuverable vehicles, such as
aircraft or grav vehicles, try to outmaneuver and fight each other. A
dogfight has no time limit, barring fuel considerations. The dogfight
ends either when one participant is disabled or destroyed, or if one
participant disengages. To disengage from a dogfight, a participant must
have Advantage and use their action that turn to throw Vehicle Skill
10+, including the DM for the vehicle’s agility.

**Attacking Vehicles**

When attacking vehicles with personal, hand-held weapons, make a regular
to-hit throw; on a hit, consult the Vehicle Penetration and Damage rules
below.

Personal weapon attacks on a non-moving vehicle enjoy DM+1 due to target
size.

Personal weapon attacks on fast-moving vehicles suffer DM-2.

Personal weapon attacks from a fast-moving vehicle (like a gunman firing
a pistol out of the window of a moving car) are penalized by DM-1. This
is cumulative with attacking a moving target.

When using a vehicle-mounted weapon, throw Gunnery 8+ to hit a target in
Effective range and 10+ to hit a target beyond it and up to maximum
range. Support and gunnery weapons use stabilized mounts and do not
suffer the DM-1 for attacking from a fast-moving vehicle.

Throw Gunnery 8+ to hit a target with vehicle-mounted weapons at the
Support Weapon’s Effective range. At Maximum range, this throw becomes
10+. Gunnery Weapons have long ranges and for typical tactical
engagements or chases covered by these rules, Gunnery weapon targets
will almost always be within Effective range.

**Vehicle Penetration and Damage**

When you hit a vehicle, throw the weapon’s AV dice. If the throw is
equal to or exceeds the vehicle’s Armor Rating, the attack has
penetrated the vehicle’s armor and caused internal damage. Roll one
damage throw on the vehicle damage table. If the AV throw is equal to
*twice* the target's Armor Rating or greater, the attack has scored an

| 12     | Critical           | Destroyed           |

The following are the damage effects on vehicles. Note that additional
hits on a disabled system will have no further effect.

**Regular Damage**

**Breach:** If the vehicle is pressurized, its environmental seal is
breached, exposing its occupants to the environment. Patching an
environmental seal breach requires either pre-packaged emergency hull
patches (most air-tight vehicles carry 1D of these) – which may be used
within 1 combat round - or a Repair 5+ throw and 1D minutes.

A breached watercraft begins to leak, reducing its speed by one quarter
and inflicting a cumulative DM-1 to all throws related to the vehicle's
steering. Four such breaches will cause the watercraft to take on too
much water and begin to sink. It will sink within 1D minutes; if repair
supplies are available, water breaches may be patched with a successful
Repair 6+ throw.

**Cargo:** 1 ton of cargo is destroyed. If no cargo remains, this
becomes an Occupants hit.

**Occupants:** 1D occupants chosen randomly by the Referee are injured
and take 3D damage each. Subtract personal armor from this damage if
applicable. If there are less occupants than the roiled number,
distribute the hits randomly between the remaining occupants, which
means that an occupant may suffer a double hit.

**Weapon:** One of the vehicle's weapons is disabled and may not fire.

**Locomotion:** The vehicle's locomotion or engine is disabled, and it
cannot move. In case of aircraft or high-flying grav vehicles, this
might cause a crash; throw Aircraft 6+ or Grav Vehicle 6+ (respectively)
to land safely, otherwise the aircraft crashes; roll on the Critical
Damage table

**Electronics:** One or more of the vehicle's electronic systems is
destroyed, usually the computer systems or major sensors/radar. Flying
an aircraft or Grav vehicle with damaged electronics incurs a DM-2
penalty to all vehicle throws.

**Power Plant:** The vehicle's power plant is disabled. The vehicle is
immobile and cannot use electronics or energy weapons. In case of
aircraft or grav vehicles, this might cause a crash; throw Aircraft or
Grav Vehicle 8+ to land safely, otherwise roll on the Critical Damage
table.

**Critical:** Massive internal damage. Roll on the Critical Damage table
instead.

**Critical Hits**

**Knocked Out:** The vehicle is seriously damaged and inoperable until
it undergoes major repairs at a full-scale workshop. Each occupant must
throw END 6+ to avoid taking 3D damage. High flying aircraft and grav
vehicles crash, causing 6D damage to all occupants. Low-flying vehicles
crash, causing 3D damage to all occupants. Subtract personal armor from
this damage if applicable. Watercraft, including large vessels, suffer a
massive hull breach, and will sink within 1D combat rounds.

**Crew:** All crew and passengers suffer 4D damage each. This is reduced
by personal armor, if applicable.

**Destroyed:** The vehicle is destroyed, with the loss of all hands. In
the case of ground vehicles, occupants may throw DEX 8+ to bail out
unscathed; failure causes 5D damage.

### Repairing Vehicles

Throw Repair 8+ to jury-rig a damaged or disabled system back to
functioning with a handful of spare parts. These repairs are temporary.
The system will stop functioning again after 1D hours and require
repairs at a workshop.

# Off-World Travel

The stars await! Adventurers ply the star-lanes and boldly go into the
unknown; others may serve in a navy, hunting pirates, or raiding enemy
shipping. Still others may mine asteroid belts for valuable ores,
smuggle goods to distant planets, or even engage in piracy. This chapter
covers interplanetary and interstellar travel, as well as starship
operations and procedures.

## Starports

Most worlds have starports catering to starship traffic. A typical
Cepheus (or similar OGL 2D6 Sci-Fi game) starmap lists the starport
ratings of various worlds. The following are the starport ratings and
services available:

**Starport A:** Excellent facilities. Shipyard may construct any ship.
Full repairs available. Refined fuel available.

**Starport B:** Good facilities. Shipyard may construct small craft.
Full repairs available. Refined fuel available.

**Starport C:** Average facilities. Full repairs available. Unrefined
fuel available.

**Starport D:** Basic facilities. Unrefined fuel available; no repair
capabilities.

**Starport E:** Frontier landing strip. No fuel or repair capabilities
available.

**Starport X:** No starport.

## Interplanetary Travel

Starships and other spacecraft in Cepheus Light have reactionless
magnetogravitic real-space thrusters with an acceleration rating from
1Gs to 6Gs. Ships normally travel under full acceleration halfway to
their destination, then decelerate for the other half of the journey.
The following table presents abstracted in-system travel times according
to the ship’s acceleration.

**Common interplanetary travel times by acceleration**

|                                        |         |         |         |         |         |         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |

| Planet to Far Neighbor                 | 3d, 17h | 2d, 15h | 2d, 3h  | 1d, 20h | 1d, 16h | 1d, 12h |
| Mainworld to Close Gas Giant           | 5d, 16h | 4d      | 3d, 7h  | 2d, 20h | 2d, 13h | 2d, 8h  |
| Mainworld to Far Gas Giant             | 6d, 23h | 4d, 22h | 4d      | 3d, 11h | 3d, 3h  | 2d, 20h |

**Landing**

Ships with streamlined hulls may land on any rocky planet or planetoid,
regardless of atmosphere. Standard hulls may also land on planets with
atmospheres but are extremely ungainly inside an atmosphere. Dispersed
structures cannot land on any world as they will fall apart under
significant gravity.

## Interstellar Travel

Starships travel using their Jump Drives. A jump takes one week
regardless of its destination or length. Drives are rated according to
the maximum range in parsecs (map hexes) they may travel in a single
jump, from 1 to 6. Jump drives require a significant gravity well (star
system) on each side of the jump, but strong gravity will disrupt the
jump and thus ships jump at least 100 planetary diameters from any
significant celestial body.

A jump requires 10% of the ship's volume in liquid hydrogen fuel per
parsec traveled. Fuel is either refined (Cr500 per ton) or unrefined
(Cr100 per ton). Unrefined fuel may hamper jumps and even cause
misjumps. Streamlined ships may also scoop unrefined fuel from gas
giants or pump unrefined fuel from water from a world's oceans (if such
exist) at no cost. Some ships carry fuel purifiers capable of refining
fuel, but this process often takes days to complete and thus is
economically nonviable for most commercial craft.

**Interstellar Jump Procedure**

1. **Calculate Plot**: A jump requires a “jump plot”. Starports rated D
   or better sell up-to-date jump plots to nearby populated worlds and
   vessels for Cr1000 per parsec. A skilled pilot can also calculate
   their own jump plot. Throw Piloting 4+ to calculate a jump plot;
   this takes 1Dx6 minutes (i.e. 1D ship combat turns). A failed check
   requires repeated calculation, or the ship will misjump (see below).
   It is possible to calculate a jump plot in advance, but it will
   become obsolete within 1D days.

2. **Jump**: Once the jump plot is ready, the ship’s engineer must
   throws 2D and adds their Engineering skill, with the following DMs.
   A throw of 0 or less causes a misjump. A bad jump plot causes an
   automatic misjump.

> DM-1 per day the jump plot is out of date
> 
> DM-2 if the Jump Drive is damaged.
> 
> DM-2 if using Unrefined fuel.
> 
> DM-8 if within a hundred-diameter limit of the nearest planet or star
> (not at jump point)

1. **In Case of a Misjump**: A misjump causes a Critical Hit on the
   ship (see the space combat rules) and may destroy it. Furthermore,
   the ship travels 1D x 1D parsecs in a random direction. If this
   leads to an empty hex on the map, the ship emerges from the misjump
   at the closest star system to that empty hex. In case there are
   multiple adjacent systems, choose one randomly.

**Sensors and Detection**

Each ship has a Sensor (or Computer) DM listed in its stat block. This
applies to all sensor throws (typically Computer throws).

Throw Computer 6+ to use a ship’s sensors for scanning and detection
purposes. Apply the ship’s Sensor DM to this throw. The Referee may
determine various further DMs to this throw based on the task at hand.

Starship sensors automatically detect any civilian ship present in the
local planetary system if it is using a transponder. Smugglers, pirates,
and naval vessels often turn off such transponders and thus require a
Computer 8+ throw to detect at long range. A **stealthed** ship applies
DM-4 to detection throws. Detecting small craft applies a further DM-2.
Detecting ships at short range is done at DM+2.

# Common Spacecraft

Some ship classes are common in a typical Cepheus Light setting. Many
other classes and designs certainly exist, but the following are very
useful for a typical campaign.

## Small Craft

Below are a few common small craft. In all cases, power plant endurance
is 2 weeks.

## Starships

The following are some of the common and archetypal starships useful in
the typical Cepheus universe.

### 300-ton Corsair

# Space Combat

The spacelanes can be dangerous. Pirates lurk near gas giants and jump
points. Vessels belonging to enemy interstellar polities might raid a
system and prey on the player characters’ ship. The player characters
might decide to engage in some piracy themselves, or they may be the
crew of a patrol frigate that has found some pirates or raiders. Use the
following rules to run the combats in such occasions.

## Space Combat Basics

Space combat typically occurs in 6-minute **rounds**. This time accounts
for weapon recharge cycles and long-range missile travel, as well as
emergency repairs. Since range is abstracted using the Advantage
mechanic (below), it is possible to run space combats at different time
frames. Each round, every crew member may take one **action**, as
detailed below. This means that crew members staffing two posts – such
as a pilot also serving as a captain – must choose only *one* post they
are filling in each round.

## Advantage

There is no initiative or range to track in space combat. Each space
combat round, all participating ships' pilots throw 2D + Piloting + the
ship's maneuver drive acceleration. The winner of this opposed throw has
Advantage and may attack with the following modifiers:

| **Effect** | **DM** |
| ---------- | ------ |
| 0          | DM-2   |
| 1 or 2     | DM-1   |
| 3 or 4     | DM+0   |
| 5+         | DM+1   |

The loser of the Advantage throw suffers DM-3 to attack anyone with a
higher Advantage number than them, for the round. This penalty applies
to turrets and bays. Weapons in fixed mounts cannot attack without
Advantage. Note that two vessels that have the same result for their
Advantage throw can still attack each other, albeit at DM-2 to their
attack throws.

Vessels with disabled Maneuver drives automatically lose Advantage.
Fixed space stations roll Advantage normally. They simply do not have a
bonus from maneuver drives. Instead of Piloting, station commanders
throw 2D + Gunnery for Advantage. It is difficult, but not impossible,
to stay in the blind spot of a station-mounted turret.

It is possible to have multiple ships engaged in combat. Simply record
the different Advantage results in descending order. The ships higher on
the “ladder” have Advantage on any ship below them.

The battle ends either when one participant is disabled or destroyed, or
if one participant disengages.

## Actions

Each character may act once in each combat round. There are five
positions aboard a ship: Captain, Pilot, Sensor Operator, Gunner, and
Engineer, each with its own actions. There may, of course, be multiple
characters acting as gunners or engineers.

### Captain's Actions

**Support Crew:** throw Leadership 8+. If successful, gain a pool of
positive DM points equal to the Effect (minimum 1) that the captain may
distribute as they see fit for the next round. For example, a roll of 12
generates a pool of 4 points, which can be given to one crewmember for a
DM+4, or to four separate crewmembers, for a DM+1 each.

**Outmaneuver:** the captain throws Tactics 10+. If successful, apply a
DM+2 to the ship's next round's Advantage throw.

### Pilot Actions

**Dock:** Docking with a moving hostile ship is nearly impossible.
Docking with a ship unable to maneuver is automatic.

**Disengage**: To disengage from ship combat, a ship must have Advantage
and use their Pilot action that round to throw an opposed Piloting roll
vs. the pursuer's Pilot, adding each ship’s thrust rating. The quarry
escapes if its pilot wins the opposed throw. Alternatively, a
jump-capable ship may jump out of combat.

**Evasive Maneuvers:** the pilot throws Piloting 12+, modified by the
ship’s available maneuver drive Thrust. On a success, apply a negative
DM equal to the Pilot’s skill (to a maximum of DM-2) to all incoming
attacks. This does not require Advantage.

**Plot Jump:** The pilot may attempt to plot a jump as noted in the
Off-World Travel chapter above. It is also possible to plot a jump
faster, but this imposes a DM-2 per round reduced, to a minimum of 1
round.

**Emergency Jump:** throw Piloting 6+ to initiate an emergency jump
while under fire; if successful, the ship’s engineer must throw
Engineering 8+ to power the jump. Failures may be retried in the next
round. See the Ship Operations chapter above for the jump procedure
itself. Note this applies DM-2 to the Jump Throw, increasing the chance
of misjump. This requires a jump plot, as noted above – either prepared
beforehand or generated during combat.

### Sensor Operator's Actions

**Spoof Missiles**: Electronic warfare can defeat incoming missiles;
throw Computer 8+ to spoof an incoming missile due to impact that round,
or the next round. The sensor operator must roll to successfully spoof
each missile. Multiple missiles may be spoofed each round.

**Jam Sensors**: Electronic warfare can provide “cover” to a ship. Roll
Opposed Computer against one enemy vessel. If successful, the target of
the Jamming suffers a DM equal to the skill level of the sensor operator
(to a DM-3 cap) to any attack throw made against the jamming ship. This
is cumulative with a pilot's Evasive Maneuvers.

**Target Systems:** throws Computer 10+. If successful, a single gunner
in the crew may choose to target a specific system on the enemy ship
with one attack. If that gunner’s next attack is successful and does
damage, they may select which system the attack has hit.

### Gunner's Actions

**Fire Energy Weapons:** throw Gunnery 8+ to hit a target with an energy
weapon.

**Launch Missiles:** the gunner launches one missile per rack in the
turret. Throw Gunnery 5+ before launch to lock the missile on its
target. Failure to lock prevents launching but keeps the missile intact.

Missiles ignore Advantage modifiers but are vulnerable to point-defense
fire and electronic warfare spoofing. Missiles will hit their target the
*next* round after their launch, allowing the target to target the
missile with point-defense and spoofing, if desired. On the round
missiles reach their target, throw 4+ to hit the target, unmodified by
any skill. The Evasive Maneuvers Pilot action affects this missile
attack throw. Smart missiles may retry this throw once at 8+, in the
following round.

**Point Defense:** The gunner may allocate their weapon(s) to Point
Defense, as noted below.

**Launch Sand:** throw Gunnery 6+. If successful, all incoming laser and
particle beam fire from a single target suffer DM-2 to hit. Sand clouds
last for one round. Each sand canister can block fire from one ship, so
a double or triple sandcaster turret can help the ship defend against
multiple threats at once or provide a denser defense against a single
threat. Note that this modifier does not stack; each ship can be
affected only once by a given target's sand clouds.

## Streamlined Turret Fire

To reduce the amount of die rolls in ship combat, we recommend that for
ships with over 3 turrets, each double or triple turret should carry the
same type of weapons. This allows all weapons to share the same attack
throw, causing a single hit but attacking at DM+1 for a double turret or
at DM+2 for a triple turret. All weapons in such a turret must attack
the same target. If launching missiles, all missiles in the same turret
share a single locking throw but hit their target individually.

## Point Defense

At the beginning of each round, the defender decides how many, if any,
energy weapons will be dedicated to point defense. This applies a -DM to
all incoming missiles' hit throws, per the following table.

| **Weapons** | **DM to incoming missiles** |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| 1           | -1                          |
| 2-4         | -2                          |
| 5-7         | -3                          |
| 8+          | -4                          |

### Engineer Actions

Any character with the Engineering skill can perform **Damage Control**
– emergency repairs of damaged systems and breaches. Multiple characters
with this skill may perform damage control at the same time, each on a
different system. Throw Engineering 8+ to repair a damaged system or to
jury-rig a single disabled system back into operation. Success
temporarily repairs one hit on the system. The damage will reappear in
1D hours.

**Overcharge Weapon**: the engineer can disable the safeties on an
energy weapon for extra damage. Throw Engineering 8+ to boost a single
energy weapon’s Hits rating by +1.

**Redline Engines:** the ship’s chief engineer throws Engineering 8+. On
a success, the ship’s thrust increases by 1 for next round (including
the Advantage throw).

## Naval Weapons

The following table lists turret weapons. The complete Cepheus Engine
rules also provides bay weapons for larger ships, but here, for
simplicity's sake, turret weapons shall suffice.

|               |                |                 |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **Weapon**    | **Damage**     | **Hits**        |
| Missile Rack  | 2D per missile | 2               |
| Pulse Laser   | 1D             | 2               |
| Sandcaster    | Special        | Special         |
| Particle Beam | 2D             | 1 + 1 radiation |
| Beam Laser    | 2D             | 1               |

### 

### Turret weapon notes

**Regular missiles** cost Cr1200 each; smart missiles, Cr2500 each;
nuclear missiles, Cr50000 each but are not normally available to
civilians. **Smart missiles** hit on a throw of 6+ regardless of the
gunner’s skill, and if they miss their target, they may re-roll this
throw once the following round. **Nuclear missiles** cause 3D damage and
2 hits + 1 radiation hit. The Space Combat chapter explains the missile
attack procedure.

A single missile rack holds 3 missiles and each ton of cargo space can
accommodate 12 missiles. Loading a rack from nearby ordinary cargo takes
the gunner a full space combat round. A pre-designated missile magazine
allows automatic loading, but prevents that space from being used for
cargo when not carrying missiles.

**Sandcasters** launch anti-laser sand canisters, as described in the
ship combat chapter. A single sandcaster holds 6 sand canisters, and a
single ton of cargo can hold 24 sand canisters. Magazines can serve for
sand just like for missiles, and a magazine can be used for both
interchangeably, at an exchange rate of two canisters per missile.

**Particle Beams** blast enemies with beams of charged particles,
causing both structural and radiation damage. This is the lightest
military-grade energy weapon available, and many polities restrict its
use to military and paramilitary ships.

**Beam Lasers** are weak but lasers firing continuous beams.

## Damage and Hits

When an attack hits an armored ship, throw the weapon’s damage dice. If
the throw is equal to the target’s Armor rating or higher, the attack
penetrates and causes damage. Attacks always penetrate unarmored ships.
For example, when a beam laser hits a ship with Armor 4, throw 4+ on the
laser’s 2D damage to penetrate. The armor will block any lower roll.

For each weapon that Penetrates, make one throw on the following table.
Each "hit" a weapon causes (see the weapon description) brings a
separate roll on this table.

## Penetration Description

The following is a description of ship system penetration hits. Note
that if a system is destroyed, any further damage on the same system has
no further effect.

**Armor**

Reduce the ship’s armor rating by 1. Ignore if the ship has no armor.

**Breach**

The ship suffers a hull breach and is exposed to vacuum. Anyone not
wearing a Vacc Suit or in a sealed compartment suffers exposure to
vacuum per the environmental hazard chapter.

**Bridge**

Bridge disabled; Captain, Pilot, and Sensor Operator actions are
impossible until the bridge is repaired, and Gunnery throws suffer DM-2.
The crew suffers a Crew Hit (see below).

**Crew**

1D crew members and passengers suffer 2D damage each. If there are fewer
people than the number rolled, one or more of them, randomly determined,
will receive multiple hits. This damage can be reduced by personal
armor.

**Critical Crew Hit**

All crew and passengers suffer 4D damage each. This damage can be
reduced by personal armor.

**Computer**

Computer disabled. Jumps and sensor use are impossible until the
computer is repaired.

**Fuel**

1Dx10% of the fuel tank capacity is destroyed.

**Hold**

1Dx10% of cargo is destroyed.

**J-Drive**

Jump drive disabled.

**M-Drive**

Maneuver drive disabled. The ship is adrift and will always lose
Advantage.

**Power Plant**

Power plant disabled. The ship is functioning on emergency power. Energy
weapons fire is impossible. The ship will always lose Advantage.

**Weapons**

Disable 1DX10% of all weapons (rounded up).

## Repairing Damage

A jury-rigged system will fail within 1D hours. After that, the system
requires full repairs. Throw Engineering 6+ to repair a damaged system;
this takes 1D hours and requires 0.02 ton of spare parts per ton of
repaired system. A successful throw returns the system to full
functioning. A failed throw may be repeated but will require additional
spare parts. Spare parts cost Cr100,000 per ton, and may be stored in
the ship's cargo bay.

# Environmental Hazard

Not all threats carry weapons. Starfarers must consider disease,
radiation, and extreme environments when exploring distant stars. This
chapter provides simple rules for these hazards.

## Disease and Poison

When a character is exposed to a disease or poison, they must make an
Endurance throw. The target is the pathogen’s Virulence number. If
successful, the character shrugs off the effect. If the throw is failed,
the disease damages the character’s END according to the listed damage.
The infected character must repeat this throw after the pathogen’s
listed interval. Success means recovery and failure causes the listed
damage, again. If this damage reduces the character’s END to zero,
additional damage applies to STR or DEX (player’s choice). The character
cannot heal this damage until they recover from the illness or
poisoning. Note that most poisons do not have an interval, but rather
cause their damage immediately upon poisoning and only once.

**Sample pathogens**

|                   |               |             |              |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Pathogen**      | **Virulence** | **Damage**  | **Interval** |
| Pneumonia         | 6+            | 1D          | 1D weeks     |
| Anthrax           | 9+            | 1D          | 1D days      |
| Biological Weapon | 12+           | 3D          | 1D hours     |
| Arsenic           | 8+            | 2D          | \-           |
| Tranq Gas         | 10+           | Unconscious | \-           |

## Extreme Temperatures

Extreme environments damage unprotected characters, as noted in the
table below.

**Extreme Temperatures**

|                 |            |                |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Temperature** | **Damage** | **Example**    |
| -100° or less   | 1D/round   | Deep space     |
| -50°            | 2D/hour    | Mars           |
| -25°            | 1D/hour    | Arctic         |
| -10° to 40°     | None       | Typical Terra  |
| 50°             | 1D/hour    | Searing desert |
| 100°            | 2D/hour    | Boiling point  |
| 200° or more    | 1D/round   | Mercury        |

## 

## Fire

When attacked by fire, characters must throw DEX 8+ to avoid catching
fire. A burning character takes 2D damage per round. Make another DEX 8+
throw each subsequent round; if successful, the character puts out the
fire. If failed, the character suffers another 2D damage. Putting out
the fire by other means, such as an extinguisher, also stops this
continuous damage.

## Falling

A character suffers 1D damage per 2m fallen, up to 6D at terminal
velocity. Multiply this damage by the world’s gravity rating in Gs. For
example, falling 10 meters on a world with 0.45Gs would inflict 5D
damage, which is then multiplied by 0.45 for the actual damage result –
2.5D rounded up to 3D.

## Starvation and Dehydration

A character requires two liters of water and 0.5kg of food per day to
stay healthy.

A character may go without water for 20 hours + twice their END score
with no ill effect. After that time has passed, the character must throw
END 6+ per hour without water or suffer 1D damage. There is a cumulative
DM-1 per each check.

A character may go without food for 3 days. After that, the character
must throw END 6+ per day without food or suffer 1D damage. There is a
cumulative DM-1 per each previous check.

The character can recover this damage only after drinking and eating.

## Suffocation

In cases of insufficient oxygen, such as on a ship with failing life
support, characters suffer 1D damage per minute. If the character has no
access to any oxygen whatsoever, such as when a character is being
strangled, or has been sucked out into space, this becomes 1D damage per
round instead.

## Vacuum Exposure

Contrary to popular belief, vacuum does not kill immediately. A
character exposed to vacuum suffers regular suffocation damage (above).
While exposed to space they also suffer 3Dx10 rads of radiation per
round. Additionally, beginning from the third round of vacuum exposure,
the character must throw END 10+ per round or fall unconscious from
aeroembolisms – the formation of air bubbles in their blood stream.
